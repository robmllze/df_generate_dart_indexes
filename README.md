## Summary

A tool to generate index/exports files for all Dart files in a directory.

## Usage Instructions

1. You do not need to add this package to your pubspec.yaml file.
2. Activate the tool by running: `dart pub global activate df_generate_dart_indexes`.
3. Navigate to a folder in your project using the terminal (Tip: If you're using VS Code, you can right-click on a folder and select `"Open in Integrated Terminal"`).
4. Run `dartindexes .` to generate an `_index.g.dart` file at the current location `.`.

### Note:

Files that start with an underscore, files in folders that start with an underscore, and generated files (those with the `.g.dart` extension) will be omitted from `_index.g.dart`.
